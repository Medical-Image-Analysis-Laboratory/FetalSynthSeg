Following FetalSynthSeg weights are available for download:
- `KISPI-mial_fss.ckpt`: Weights of the model trained on synthetic data from KISPI-mial dataset
- `KISPI-irtk_fss.ckpt`: Weights of the model trained on synthetic data from KISPI-irtk dataset
- `KISPI-mial_real.ckpt`: Weights of the model trained on real data from KISPI-mial dataset
- `KISPI-irtk_real.ckpt`: Weights of the model trained on real data from KISPI-irtk dataset
- `KISPI-all_fss.ckpt`: Weights of the model trained on synthetic data from both KISPI-irtk and KISPI-mial datasets


Download the weights and place them in the `weights/` folder to use them for inference.

`CHUV-mial` weights are not available for download, as the dataset is not publicly available.
